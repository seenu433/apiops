## Prerequisites
Please check that you have the following requirements to complete the hands-on lab:

- Azure requirements
  - Access to the [Azure Portal](https://www.portal.azure.com)
  - Access to an active [Azure subscription](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade)
  - Contributor role in a resource group to be able to deploy an API Management instance
- Access to a valid [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) organization if you plan on using AZDO.
- Access to a valid [Github](https://www.github.com) organization if you plan on using Github. Make sure you create your repo as a public repo as it is required to create Github [environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) which will be utilized throughout this lab. To use environments with private repos you will need access to a Github Enterprise Organization.

**An API Management instance can take some time to provision.** Please follow the steps outlined in APIM Creation prior to the workshop.
