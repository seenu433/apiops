## Create APIM artifacts in GitHub from extractor tool


1. Head to the actions section within your repository and manually run the  "Run - Extractor" workflow. ![pipeline variable group](../../assets/images/GithubActionsRunExtractor.png)

3. Under **Pull requests** section on your github repo, you should see a new pull request with the extracted artifacts. **Don't merge the Pull Request yet** as we still need to configure the Run-Publisher.yaml file in the next section before we merge. You can always rerun the pipeline to refresh your repository with the latest Azure changes.
